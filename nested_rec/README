This is a dir for exploratory programming with nested recursion.
The motivation for this is my travail in type checking a nested recursive function. I was trying to convert a regular double recursion into a nested double recursion i.e. roughly transforming 

let rec foo =
	...
	foo <args> <op> foo <args>

to

let rec bar =
	...
	(bar bar <ags>)
